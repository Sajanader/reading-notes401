## What’s a Linked List?
In the world of software, the ways that we choose to organize our information is half the battle. Here’s the thing though: there are so many ways to solve a problem. And when it comes to organizing our data, there are lots of tools that could work for the job. The trick is knowing which tool is the right one to use.
Regardless of which language we start coding in, one of the first things that we encounter are data structures, which are the different ways that we can organize our data; variables, arrays, hashes, and objects are all types of data structures. But these are still just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to data structures; there are a lot more, some of which start to sound super complicated the more that you hear about them.
One of those complicated things for me has always been linked lists. I’ve known about linked lists for a few years now, but I can never quite keep them straight in my head. I only really think about them when I’m preparing for (or sometimes, in the middle of) a technical interview, and someone asks me about them. I’ll do a little research and think that I understand what they’re about, but after a few weeks, I forget them again. The whole thing is pretty inefficient, and it all stems from the fact that I know they exist, but I don’t fundamentally understand them! So, it’s time to change that and answer the question: what on earth is a linked list, anyway?

## Linear data structures
If we really want to understand the basics of linked lists, it’s important that we talk about what type of data structure they are.
One characteristic of linked lists is that they are linear data structures, which means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed. We can think of a linear data structure like a game of hopscotch: in order to get to the end of the list, we have to go through all of the items in the list in order, or sequentially. Linear structures, however, are the opposite of non-linear structures. In non-linear data structures, items don’t have to be arranged in order, which means that we could traverse the data structure non-sequentially.
