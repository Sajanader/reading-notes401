## Overview
An HTML Form is a group of one or more fields/widgets on a web page, which can be used to collect information from users for submission to a server. Forms are a flexible mechanism for collecting user input because there are suitable widgets for entering many different types of data, including text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, date pickers and so on. Forms are also a relatively secure way of sharing data with the server, as they allow us to send data in POST requests with cross-site request forgery protection.

## The form is defined
in HTML as a collection of elements inside <form>...</form> tags, containing at least one input element of type="submit".
```
<form action="/team_name_url/" method="post">
    <label for="team_name">Enter name: </label>
    <input id="team_name" type="text" name="name_field" value="Default name for team.">
    <input type="submit" value="OK">
</form>
```

* a form may have any number of other input elements and their associated labels.
* The field's type attribute defines what sort of widget will be displayed. 
* The name and id of the field are used to identify the field in JavaScript/CSS/HTML,
* while value defines the initial value for the field when it is first displayed. 
* The matching team label is specified using the label tag (see "Enter name" above), with a for field containing the id value of the associated input.

* The submit input will be displayed as a button (by default) that can be pressed by the user to upload the data in all the other input elements in the form to the server (in this case, just the team_name). T
* he form attributes define the HTTP method used to send the data and the destination of the data on the server (action):

* action: The resource/URL where data is to be sent for processing when the form is submitted. If this is not set (or set to an empty string), then the form will be submitted back to the current page URL.
* method: The HTTP method used to send the data: post or get.
* The POST method should always be used if the data is going to result in a change to the server's database because this can be made more resistant to cross-site forgery request attacks.
* The GET method should only be used for forms that don't change user data (e.g. a search form). It is recommended for when you want to be able to bookmark or share the URL.

## How does it work?
The role of the server is first to render the initial form state â€” either containing blank fields or pre-populated with initial values. After the user presses the submit button, the server will receive the form data with values from the web browser and must validate the information. If the form contains invalid data, the server should display the form again, this time with user-entered data in "valid" fields and messages to describe the problem for the invalid fields. Once the server gets a request with all valid form data, it can perform an appropriate action (e.g. saving the data, returning the result of a search, uploading a file, etc.) and then notify the user.

## URL configuration:
```
urlpatterns += [
    path('book/<uuid:pk>/renew/', views.renew_book_librarian, name='renew-book-librarian'),
]
```
## View:
```
import datetime

from django.shortcuts import render, get_object_or_404
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect
from django.urls import reverse

from catalog.forms import RenewBookForm

def renew_book_librarian(request, pk):
    book_instance = get_object_or_404(BookInstance, pk=pk)

    # If this is a POST request then process the Form data
    if request.method == 'POST':

        # Create a form instance and populate it with data from the request (binding):
        form = RenewBookForm(request.POST)

        # Check if the form is valid:
        if form.is_valid():
            # process the data in form.cleaned_data as required (here we just write it to the model due_back field)
            book_instance.due_back = form.cleaned_data['renewal_date']
            book_instance.save()

            # redirect to a new URL:
            return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('all-borrowed') )

    # If this is a GET (or any other method) create the default form.
    else:
        proposed_renewal_date = datetime.date.today() + datetime.timedelta(weeks=3)
        form = RenewBookForm(initial={'renewal_date': proposed_renewal_date})

    context = {
        'form': form,
        'book_instance': book_instance,
    }

    return render(request, 'catalog/book_renew_librarian.html', context)
```
## The template:


```
{% extends "base_generic.html" %}

{% block content %}
  <h1>Renew: {{ book_instance.book.title }}</h1>
  <p>Borrower: {{ book_instance.borrower }}</p>
  <p{% if book_instance.is_overdue %} class="text-danger"{% endif %}>Due date: {{ book_instance.due_back }}</p>

  <form action="" method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    <table>
    {{ form.as_table }}
    </table>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  </form>
{% endblock %}
```
