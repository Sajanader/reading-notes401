* Model - a set of patterns learned from data.
* Algorithm - a specific ML process used to train a model.
* Training data - the dataset from which the algorithm learns the model.
* Test data - a new dataset for reliably evaluating model performance.
* Features - Variables (columns) in the dataset used to train the model.
* Target variable - A specific variable you're trying to predict.
* Observations - Data points (rows) in the dataset.


## The 3 Elements of Great Machine Learning
* ### A skilled chef (human guidance)
* ###  Fresh ingredients (clean, relevant data)
* ## Don't overcook it (avoid overfitting)

1. ### Exploratory Analysis
It depends on statistical methods and equisions.

2. ### Data Cleaning 
The first step to data cleaning is removing unwanted observations from your dataset.
Checking for irrelevant observations before engineering features can save you many headaches down the road.

**Better data beats fancier algorithms.**

3. ### Feature,engineering
is about creating new input features from your existing ones.

4. ### Algorithm Selection

***Note**:linear regression suffers from two main flaws:
It's prone to overfit with many input features.
It cannot easily express non-linear relationships.*

**Regularization** is a technique used to prevent overfitting by artificially penalizing model coefficients.

There are 3 common types of regularized linear regression algorithms.

1.  Lasso Regression
2.  Ridge Regression
3.  Elastic-Net

5. ## Model Training
