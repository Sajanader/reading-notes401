## The Best Whiteboard Interview Advice I Ever Received
1. The Advice: Communicate!
> What Do You Mean Communicate?
Let’s say you are in the interview and your interviewers throw you a whiteboard question. Do you step up to the whiteboard and feverishly start solving the problem?
No!
That tends to be everyone’s instinct, but it’s definitely not the right way to go. Even if you think you understand the problem, you should take some very important steps before moving forward.
First, Restate the Question
2. Ask About Edge Cases
3. Ask About Test Cases
4. Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense.
5. Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good.
6. Stuck? Ask for Help!
7. Bonus: Communicating Prior to the Interview
8. We’re All Human
Above all, remember that we’re all human. Your interviewer has been in your position and understands the stress of a technical interview. Your interviewer has probably seen quite a few candidates sweating it out, but possibly very few open who openly discuss problems in a conversational manner. If you can achieve this, you’ll be in great shape.
