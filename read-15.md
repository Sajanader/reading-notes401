## Trees
In this tutorial, we’ll be covering Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees. We will review some common terminology that is shared amongst all of the trees and then dive into specifics of the different types.

## Common Terminology
Node - A node is the individual item/data that makes up the data structure
Root - The root is the first/top Node in the tree
Left Child - The node that is positioned to the left of a root or node
Right Child - The node that is positioned to the right of a root or node
Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not contain any children
Height - The height of a tree is determined by the number of edges from the root to the bottommost node



## Traversals
An important aspect of trees is how to traverse them. Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree, and much more! There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

Depth First
Breadth First
Depth First
Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first. There are multiple ways to carry out depth first traversal, and each method changes the order in which we search/print the root. Here are three methods for depth first traversal:

Pre-order: root >> left >> right
In-order: left >> root >> right
Post-order: left >> right >> root
